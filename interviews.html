        Interview with Roshani Chokshi:
      </div>
      <br>
          <h2>1. Have you hidden any secrets in the Pandava series that only a few people would find?</h2>
          <p>
            Of course! There are always Easter Eggs, and small ways in which I try to tie all of my series together.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>2. Is there anything that you had to edit out of the books that you really didn’t want to?</h2>
          <p>
            Dialogue! When the Potatoes get going...they really don't stop, and it was so very hard to pull back and make them focus on the ACTUAL PLOT!
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>3. What literary pilgrimages have you gone on for the Pandava series?</h2>
          <p>
            Does Home Depot count? Truthfully, I've set a lot of the Aru Shah series around landmarks of my home city, Atlanta. All the places Aru goes to or ventures to (minus that one Illinois detour in book 2) are places that I've frequented growing up or places that I continue to love now, as an adult. Home Depot included. The Museum of Ancient Indian Art and Culture where Aru lives is directly inspired by the Carlos Museum on the campus of Emory University, which is where I attended college.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>4. What was your favorite book to write in the Pandava series? (By Lia)</h2>
          <p>
            My favorite book in the series is always the most recent one I've finished, mostly because I've defied the book attempting to destroy all my brain cells in the act of writing it.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>5. When did you ever get the idea to write this series? Were there any inspirations for the characters? Do you ever plan to write another book from a different perspective than Aru? (By Selene & He Hai Liu)</h2>
          <p>
            In a way, I've always had the idea for Aru. I am a huge Sailor Moon fan, and was always writing stories featuring me and my best friends with supernatural powers and on adventures. I grew up hearing Hindu myths and folklore from my grandmother (and Filipino myths and folklore from my Filipina mom!) and it was sometime in 2016 when the Rick Riordan Presents imprint was announced that the ideas instantly crystallized in my head. I've always loved the Mahabharata, and the tales of the Pandava brother that the concept of flipping the script a little, inserting myself and my loved ones, my adoration for Sailor Moon-esque girl gangs coalesced into the Aru Shah series pretty much on the spot.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>6. How long have you been writing and have you ever felt like it wasn’t worth it? How do you stay committed to a project? (By Ru & Candace J. Will)</h2>
          <p>
            Years and years...and yes. I think the important thing is writing for yourself. Write what you want to read. Write what you know to be true. Honor that idea and your own voice by seeing a project to the end. That's not a hard and fast rule by the way, there are plenty of stories that I've abandoned midway through because I couldn't find the heart of the tale.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>7. Can you give any hints on what will happen in the fifth book? (By He Hai Liu)</h2>
          <p>
            Nope >:)
