          <td>Starting off, I LOVED reading Red Queen. I had broken my 2021 reading speed with this book and it helped me out of my reading slump. The world building is not too intense, helping readers understand and also at the same time making it feel like a fantasy world. I enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end and the plot was also well done in my opinion. The prose and diction of the book was also admirable, there weren’t many times when I felt bored and I greatly appreciate that! In conclusion, this book was a fun read. Well, actually, not fun. More like entertaining because some things in this book were not, indeed, “fun”, if you know what I mean.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Glass Sword:</td>
          <td>The sequel to Red Queen definitely had sequel vibes. I’m going to get straight to the point. The pros of this book (which are the reasons why I gave it 4 stars) are that the characters have been developed beautifully. My most favorite part was seeing Mare change and *adapt* to the change around her. I’m not saying that I enjoy seeing her suffer, I’m saying that I’m fascinated by Aveyard’s creation and Mare’s character development. Another thing that I love about this book are the characters that are being shown, Shade’s death was very well foreshadowed, taking into account how he got some special attention and Maven’s abuse of power as king. The cons of this book, in my opinion, is the writing itself. There were many times where I found myself zoning out or bored. It’s true, all books have these moments but GS had a lot. Some of the writing also sounded repetitive, the internal monologue often had the same formula and got a little galling. In short, this book was a good read, while it lacked some substance and ✨pizzazz✨ at parts, it’s definitely worth reading because I’ve heard some interesting things about King’s Cage. The ending also has me wanting to read more!
